Ralf Gommers received his PhD in physics from University College London and did
his post-doctoral work at MIT, working in the field of experimental atomic
physics. After a short period working on electronics for Magnetic Resonance
Imaging devices at Philips Research, he is now a designer for advanced
lithography machines at ASML in the Netherlands. During his post-doctoral work
he became involved in the SciPy community. He is an active contributor to
NumPy, SciPy and statsmodels, and has also contributed to scikit-image. Ralf
has been the NumPy release manager for two years, and is currently the SciPy
release manager.

Brian Granger is an Assistant Professor of Physics at Cal Poly State University
in San Luis Obispo, CA. He has a background in theoretical atomic, molecular
and optical physics, with a Ph.D from the University of Colorado. His current
research interests include quantum computing, parallel and distributed
computing and interactive computing environments for scientific and technical
computing. He is a core developer of the IPython project and is an active
contributor to a number of other open source projects focused on scientific
computing in Python.


Perry Greenfield

Perry Greenfield received a Ph.D. in Physics from M.I.T. His thesis was based
on Very Large Array radio observations of the first discovered gravitational
lens. After a short stint in communications engineering at Bell Labs, he ended
up at the Space Telescope Science Institute, where he has worked for the last
26 years. He initially was responsible for calibrating the Faint Object Camera
for the Hubble Space Telescope, but for the last 16 years he has been
leading the Science Software Branch. He has pioneered the use of Python in
astronomy, and his group has been heavily involved in Python for the last 12
years. They have developed PyRAF, numarray (the precursor to current NumPy
capabilities), PyFITS, and been heavily involved in the development and
support of matplotlib. His group is now heavily involved in developing the
science software to support the next large space telescope under
construction, the James Webb Space Telescope.


Cindee Madison

Cindee is a data scientist, software engineer, and project manager with over 10
years experience in scientific computing. She is a strong proponent of
reproducible science, with proven expertise in data mining, complex problem
solving, analytics, algorithm and software development. Cindee recieved a M.A.
in Psychology and Computer Science from University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in
2002 and has held various positions at the University of California -- Berkeley
working in neuroscience since 2002. Her specialties include python,
numpy/scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, scikit-image, vim, testing, neuroscience,
explaining how things work to a wide range of skill levels.

Jarrod Millman is a graduate student in Biostatistics at UC Berkeley.  Prior to
starting graduate school, Jarrod was the director of computing for UC
Berkeley’s Neuroscience Institute, where he helped found the Neuroimaging in
Python (NIPY) project.  From 2007 to 2009, he was the release manager for NumPy
and SciPy.  He has also previously served as the conference chair for both the
US and the India SciPy conferences.  His current interests concern statistics,
neuroinformatics, reproducible research, and scientific computing.
