		<h1>Level I Projects</h1>
		<h2><a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a></h2>
		<img src="/media/img/projects/NumPY.png" alt="NumPy Logo"/>
		<p>NumPy is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank">SciPy</a></h2>
		<img src="/media/img/projects/scipy.png" alt="SciPy Logo"/>
		<p>SciPy is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It is also the name of a very popular conference on scientific programming with Python. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a></h2>
		<img src="/media/img/projects/matplotlib.png" alt="Matplotlib Logo"/>
		<p>2D plotting library for Python that produces high quality figures that can be used in various hardcopy and interactive environments. Matplolib is compatible with Python scripts and the Python and IPython shells, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://ipython.org/" target="_blank">IPython</a></h2>
		<img src="/media/img/projects/ipython.png" alt="IPython Logo"/>
		<p>High quality open source Python shell that includes tools for high level and interactive parallel computing.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://sympy.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">SymPy</a></h2>
		<img src="/media/img/projects/SymPy2.jpg" alt="SymPy Logo"/>
		<p>SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://cython.org/" target="_blank">Cython</a></h2>
		<img src="/media/img/projects/cython.png" alt="Cython Logo"/>
		<p>Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">pandas</a></h2>
		<img src="/media/img/projects/pandas.png" alt="pandas Logo"/>
		<p>pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.</p>
