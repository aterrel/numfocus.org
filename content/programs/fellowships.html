		<h1>Fellowship Programs</h1>
		<h2>Numfocus Technology Fellowship Program</h2>

		<h3>Purpose:</h3>
		<p>The Numfocus Technology Fellowship Program aims to bridge the gap
		between academia and real-world, open-source scientific computing projects by
		providing a capstone experience for individuals coming from a scientific
		educational background.</p>

		<h3>Description:</h3>
		<p>The program consists of a 3-18 month project-based training
		program for senior graduate students or postdoctoral scientists.  Fellows work on actual coding projects under the guidance of mentors who are leading
		scientists and software engineers.  Collaboration with these top industry
		developers enables scientists to learn specific skills needed to contribute to cutting-edge open-source software.</p>

		<p>While proposals in any area of science and engineering are welcome, the
		following areas are encouraged in particular:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Accessible and reproducible computing</li>
			<li>Enabling technology for open access publishing</li>
			<li>Infrastructural technology supporting open-source scientific software stacks</li>
			<li>Core open-source projects promoted by NumFOCUS</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Eligibility:</h3>
		<p>Eligible applicants are postdoctoral scientists or senior PhD
		students, or have equivalent experience in physics, mathematics, engineering,
		statistics, or a related science.  The program is open to applicants from any
		nationality and can be performed at any university or institute world-wide
		(US export laws permitting).</p>
