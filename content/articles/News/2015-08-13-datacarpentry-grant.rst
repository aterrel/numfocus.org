NumFOCUS is pleased to announce that one of our sponsored projects, `Data Carpentry`_, has received $750,000 in funding from the `Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation`_.

NumFOCUS is committed to supporting and promoting world-class, innovative, open source scientific software. A fundamental component of this mission is to develop and provide training that instills good practice, enables scientific progress, and develops a diverse and strong community around open source and open science. We are excited to continue to work with Data Carpentry to grow this community! Also look for Data Carpentry contributors at upcoming `PyData`_ conferences.

Additional information about the activities to be funded by this grant is available at the `Data Carpentry blog`_.
